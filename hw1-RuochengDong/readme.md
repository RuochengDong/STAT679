## solution

# Exercise 1: Change file names  

09/15/2018  

1. The normalizeFileNames.sh is in the folder named "scripts"
2. You can run this bash code under current working folder "hw1-Ruocheng" by typing "bash scripts/normalizeFileNames.sh"
3. All codes were developed under Linux

# Exercise 2: Output summary information to csv file  

09/23/2018

1. The summarizeSNaQres.sh in the folder named "scripts"
2. Please run this bash code under the folder "scripts"(due to the relative path) by typing "bash summarizeSNaQres.sh"(bash is at same line with file name)
3. Check the results from my bash output directly or in "results" folder, a file named "stat679_exercise1-2.csv" is there
4. All codes were developed under Linux


# Exercise 3: Output more summary information in required format to csv file  

10/08/2018  

1. The updated summarizeSNaQres.sh is in the folder named "scripts"
2. Please run this bash code under the folder "scripts"(due to the relative path) by typing  
```
bash summarizeSNaQres.sh
```
3. Please wait for a couple seconds to run the code
4. Check the results from my bash output directly or in "results" folder, a file named "stat679_exercise1-3.csv" is there 
5. All codes were developed under Linux
